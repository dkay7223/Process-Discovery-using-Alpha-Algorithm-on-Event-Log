# Part (A) – Process Discovery
In this assignment, we will implement the Alpha algorithm to discover a process from a given event log. 

An excerpt of the event log is shown in the Figure below. The event log is also uploaded with the
assignment.

Throughout the assignment, students must demonstrate each step of the Alpha algorithm's output. This includes the following:

  1. Preprocessing the event log to generate multi-set of traces L and displaying it
  2. Identifying and displaying set TL
  3. Identifying and displaying start & end events (TI and TO)
  4. Identifying and displaying set PL
  5. Identifying and displaying set FL
  6. Output the resultant process

# Part (B) – Fitness of the Model: 
Determine the fitness of the model by playing out each trace on the discovered process.
